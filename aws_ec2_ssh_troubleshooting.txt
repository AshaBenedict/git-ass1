AWS SSH Client Troubleshoot


Step 1: Verify EC2 Instance Status

1. Go to the AWS Management Console → EC2 → Instances.
2. Confirm that your instance is:
   - Running (not stopped or terminated).
   - Assigned a public IPv4 address.
3. Copy the Public IPv4 address for the SSH connection.

If the instance is stopped, start it before proceeding.


Step 2: Check Security Group Rules

1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard → Instances.
2. Select your instance.
3. Scroll down and find the Security tab.
4. Click on the Security Group name associated with your instance.
5. Go to the Inbound rules and confirm you have the following rule:
   - Type: SSH
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port range: 22
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (for public access) or your IP (for restricted access).

If the rule is missing:

- Click Edit inbound rules → Add rule.
- Select:
  - Type: SSH
  - Protocol: TCP
  - Port range: 22
  - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
- Click Save rules.


Step 3: Review Network ACLs and VPC Settings

1. Go to VPC Dashboard → Network ACLs.
2. Select the ACL associated with your EC2 instance.
3. Go to the Inbound Rules and confirm:
   - Rule: SSH
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port range: 22
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0.
4. Go to the Outbound Rules and confirm:
   - Rule: Allow all traffic.
   - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0.

If port 22 is missing, add the necessary rules.


Step 4: Validate Key Pair and Permissions

If your key file has incorrect permissions, SSH will refuse the connection.

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing your .pem key:

cd C:\path\to\your\keyfile

3. Set the correct permissions:

icacls "aws1.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "aws1.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"

For Linux/WSL users:

chmod 400 aws1.pem


Step 5: SSH into the EC2 Instance

Use the correct SSH command to connect:

ssh -i "aws1.pem" ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>

For Amazon Linux instances:

ssh -i "aws1.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>


Step 6: Test Network Connectivity

If you still cannot connect, check the network connection.

1. Ping the EC2 instance:

ping <EC2-PUBLIC-IP>

- If the ping fails, the instance may be unreachable.

2. Test port 22 with Telnet or PowerShell:

Test-NetConnection <EC2-PUBLIC-IP> -Port 22

If port 22 is closed, check your security group and network settings.


Step 7: Restart the Instance

If all settings seem correct but SSH still times out:

1. Go to the EC2 console.
2. Select the instance → Instance State → Reboot.
3. Wait for the instance to boot and try connecting again.


- Elastic IP: If you frequently stop/start your instance, the public IP changes. Assign an Elastic IP for a static public IP.
- System Logs: Check EC2 system logs for issues:
  - Go to EC2 Console → Instances.
  - Select the instance → Actions → Monitor and troubleshoot → Get system log.
- SSH Agent: Use SSH agent to avoid typing the key file path every time:

Start-Service ssh-agent
ssh-add "$HOME\.ssh\aws1.pem"
ssh ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
